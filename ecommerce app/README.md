This Python script reads data from a CSV file and sends it to a Kafka topic. The CSV file contains the following fields: id, first_name, last_name, country, product_name, gender, and quantity. The script uses the Kafka Python client to connect to the Kafka broker and send the data as messages to the specified topic.
